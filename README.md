# imageprocessing-languages-comparison

This repository is just a comparison between five programming languages/software for a simple image-processing task. The codes are written in Python, C++, Julia, MATLAB, and HALCON. The task is just detecting some circles in a sample image:

The results show that OpenCV (Python and C++) have the best performance related to the other methods.
